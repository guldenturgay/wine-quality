## Comparing Classification Models for Wine Quality Prediction

In this project I wanted to compare several classification algorithms to predict wine quality which has a score between 0 and 10.

My blog post for a project walkthrough for selecting a supervised machine learning model to predict wine quality can be found [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/comparing-classification-models-for-wine-quality-prediction-6c5f26669a4f).

### Data
- I decided to compare and select an algorithm to find out what makes a good wine by using winequality-white.csv data sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality). The attributes in this dataset are: 
    - fixed acidity
    - volatile acidity
    - citric acid
    - residual sugar
    - chlorides
    - free sulfur dioxide
    - total sulfur dioxide
    - density
    - pH
    - sulfates
    - alcohol
    - quality
